# Purification Water Process Algorithm (PWPA)

**Physics-Grounded Optimization via Interpretable Process Mapping**

PWPA is a novel, physics-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that directly maps the industrial water purification processâ€”Sedimentation, Filtration, and Final Purificationâ€”into computational optimization operators. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional optimization (up to D=1000) and real-world applications like SVM hyperparameter tuning.
